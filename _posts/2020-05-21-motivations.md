It's obvious that my initial motivation to start this blog did not pan out. It might
be that I just didn't feel all that into it. It might have been that I thought that
there was no reason to do it in the first place. Regardless of the reasons I started this originally. 4 years and 1.5 months later I am clearly not a blogger.

That being said, I still like the idea of putting something out there. Not necessarily for others, mostly not for others, but if somehow a post from here reaches someone then hopefully it wasn't total waste of their time. I am hoping that I can just start writing, and maybe that will eventually lead me to being more expressive. Either way, I am going make the effort over the next year to make sure I post at least one more time. That's not a very high bar, but given the current track record that would be a significant improvement.

That's all for now.
