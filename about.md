Me in three words: Travel, Food, Technology

I work as a Site Reliability Engineer. I enjoy contributing to open source projects. Currently I work at Criteo, and as a result been able to contribute more. I have made some minor contributions to Mesos and the python JIRA library.

My current fascinations and interest are around observability, distributed systems, and sourdough.

At the time of writing this the travel is a bit restricted, but it might be a year before it's really happening very much further than my kitchen table.

For professional experience there's my LinkedIn, and my very occasional postings I have Twitter with an even lower frequency on my blog.
